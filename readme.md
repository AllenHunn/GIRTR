# GIT INSTALL RUN-TESTS RUN (GIRTR)

## PURPOSE
The purpose of this tool is to simplify the process of pulling down code for Github, installing dependencies, run all appropriate unit tests and than run the app.

It was written for the specific purpose of helping grade assignments for [Bloc](http://bloc.io), but you might find another purpose for it.

It currently supports Javascript (using Node JS) and Ruby on Rails.

## INSTALLATION
npm install --g girtr

## USAGE

girtr [gitUrl] [-b BRANCH (optional)]

Branch defaults to Master if no other is specified. 

## NEXT STEPS

I have no planned enhancements at this time. If you have some improvements, such as adding additional language support, feel free to submit a PR.
